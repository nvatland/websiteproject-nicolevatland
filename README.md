index.html
--------
The index.html file contains the resume portion of the project. The page is broken up into six sections: Intro, Profile, Experience, Skills, Education, and Contact. There is a side navigation bar that will scroll between the different sections. The main navigation bar is positioned underneath the logo, but once the user scrolls it becomes fixed to the top. This bar allows the user to navigate between the resume page (index.html) and the sales data page (data.html). When the user first loads the page, the logo (svg) is animated using CSS3 Animations.
